#  Hello

Welcome to the Pura Interview Process. Thank you for taking the time and we look forward to talking with you more.

### Task
We would like you to take this sample app and improve it in some way. The project is open ended but feel free to follow any #suggestions

Please take 2-4 hours to plan and make your improvements. Please fork this into your own public repository, make your changes, and submit a PR in your repo with your changes. (this prevents other candidates from easily viewing your changes) Then share the repository for review. 

### Purpose of Task
We want to see how you interact with an existing codebase.

A few things we will consider:
- Code Style, Quality, and Understandability
- Does it work?


Be prepared to talk about which improvements you made and why you made them in the next interview.

Feel free to reach out with any questions. nateh@pura.com
